# Detecting-Parkinsons-Disease-with-XGBoost

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a machine learning algorithm based on decision trees designed with speed and performance in mind.  
This project uses the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library to build a model that accurately detects the presence of parkinson's disease in an individual.
